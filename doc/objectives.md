## Objective
Presently, social networking is dominated by a handful of big players. It is difficult for user to move to another platform. Goal is to deconstruct social networking into components, with the purpose of:
* provide framework for creating social network providers, thus creating competition between social networks. 
* allowing publishers to simultaneously post to multiple networks
* allow consumer to view content using network of their choice

### Glossary
* publisher - content provider, anybody who creates and publishes a post, video, image and any other file
* consumer - user which views or reads published content
* social network provider - entity which helps publisher deliver content to consumer. It would also moderate content, ensure content legality in country of operation. Social network provider can dicriminate content shown to consumer using any criteria they want, block, promote, reorder, flag, or inject other content such as advertisements

### Tenets
* Primary purpose of this project is to create platform facilitating freedom of expression
* This project shall not introduce a centralized entity which can be used for censorship

## User Stories
* as a social network provider, I want to increase amount of content by showing posts my users made in other social networks
* as a social network provider, I want to increase amount of content by showing posts of my user's friends from other social networks
* as a social network provider, I want to be able to moderate the content I'm showing, such as: block spam, remove inappropriate content, blacklist or whitelist content by attribute
* as a publisher, I want to  make posts into social network, which should be distributed and moderated, but also resistant to takedown via decentralization
* as a publisher I want my posts to go to more than one social network, so that I could support more audience without re-posting
* as a publisher I want to own my friends and subscriber lists, so that I can change social network provider without losing my contacts
* as a consumer, I want to comment on a post and have it seen in all social networks at once
* as a consumer, I want to discuss content which will not natively allow comments (such as news on cnn.com), and my comments accessible globaly

### Elevator Pitch1
Imagine that you have a prominent presence on a social network FaceTube. What happens if they block you? You might not lose your content, but your audience is instantly lost and for all intents and purposes your channel is closed. Sometimes all it takes is just an AI mistakenly flagging your account, and there's nothing you can do. This puts pressure on content creators to self-censor, appease network providers instead of their audience. There is a better way to deliver content to social network. Our project separates content storage and social graph from actual social network provider. When you post content, it shows not just on FaceTube, but gets delivered simultaneously to all users in all social networks. Your subscribers are separated from FaceTube, and can access your content using any other social network of their choice. FaceTube can still block you, but all your content can still be accessed using another provider. In other words you and your following have recourse, and your channel can not be ruined by a single AI error or malicious admin.

### Elevator Pitch2
Lets say you posted an article on Facebook, that you wanted your friend to see, but your friend would refuse to use Facebook, instead would hang out on reddit. Your friend would be able to comment on your articke from reddit, and you will see the comment on facebook

### Elevator Pitch3
You see an article on CNN which you want to comment on, but you can't do it, because CNN would not allow you. You can post an article, but you need to sign up, wait for authorization, and then they may not allow your comment because it's controvercial. Instead, you post a comment here, and discuss it with everyone who came across same article without asking for premission
