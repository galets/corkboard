Presently, social networking is dominated by a handful of big players. It is
difficult for user to move to another platform. Goal of this project is to 
deconstruct social networking into components, with the purpose of:

* provide framework for creating social network providers, thus creating 
competition between social networks. 
* allowing publishers to simultaneously post to multiple networks
* allow consumer to view content using network of their choice
